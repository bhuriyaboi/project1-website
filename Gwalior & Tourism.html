Gwalior tourism Gwalior's legendary beginning stems from a meeting between Suraj Sen & the hermit Gwalipa, who lived on the hilltop where the fort stands. When Suraj Sen asked for drinking water the recluse struck a rock & a cool clear spring gushed out & after having bath from that water Suraj Senâ€™s leprosy got cured. Then in gratitude king had built the tank from the fountain & named it Suraj Kund then later on the name changed to Suhan Pal & said his descendants would remain in power as long as they kept the name pal. His next 83 descendants did just that but number 84 changed his name to Tej Karan & said Good Bye to his kingdom. Then the Tomars came in to existence in 1398 & remained in power until 1505 when Ibrahim Lodi captured it. It was Raja Man Singh [1486-1516], the most illustrious of tomars, who built the magnificient palace Man Mandir here. The Mughals, under Babar later occupied the fort. The Marathas captured it in 1784 & then finally it came into the possession of the Scindias. During the First War of Independence in 1857, it witnessed a fierce battle when thousands of Indians fought against the British under the leadership of heroic Rani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi, still in her twenties & tantya tope. It was here that Rani of Jhansi was killed fighting fiercely against heavy odds. A memorial statue is there of Rani of Jhansi.<br><br>
